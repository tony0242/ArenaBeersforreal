      <h2>Welcome To Arena Beers</h2>
      <p>Welcome to your new home for all information when it comes to brew. Here we'll put beer in an arena In a fight to see which is the best brew in your life. That's not the only thing we do at Arena beers we also go to your favorite arena and taste the best beers.
      </p>
      <p>
          When comparing beer there are three main components taste, drinkability, and occasion. Taste is very important when the beer does not taste good you don't wanna drink it is straightforward. Drinkability is how easy it goes down your gullet. I believe the perfect beer tastes great and is easy to drink you could have some dark beers that taste like chocolate but have a hard time going down because there's so much in the beer. The last factor is drinking for an occasion if you're at a party and you're playing beer pong you're not gonna waste a triple brewed barrel-aged dark stout are you no you're gonna put a pilsner in the Cup and shoot it down so the drink for the occasion is very important.
      </p>
      <h2>Battle Zone</h2>
      <p>The battle zone is where we set up two beers to compete against each other it could be anything from high-class beer to low-class beer. Each time there will be a special factor that could determine which beer is best.</p>
      </p>
      <h2>Brew Rundown</h2>

      <p>
      The brew breakdown isn't really breakdown a special type of beer or something that's less commonly known these tend to be a bit more serious but still just as fun and knowledgeable as the Battlezone.

        A monk sits, furiously scratching away at his parchment.It is near dawn and his candles have burnt down to near nothing. Still, he cannot rest until he’s finished. He won’t rest.Open jars of grains surround him, some spilled next to his parchment.He runs his hands through them before bringing them to his nose.He smiles as he lifts his parchment into the light. After countless experiments, this is it. The perfect recipe. A beer fine enough to share. This Monk isn’t your typical devotee.He has an unmatched passion for his craft and the will to go anywhere to find the right ingredients.And tonight, his devotion to his craft has paid off.

      <h2>Mead</h2>
      <p>
        What is Mead? a lot of people don't know what mead is people just think that's what they drink on Game of Thrones or in the 1500s both are true but what makes up mead is honey and the fermentation of it. It's made to a similar process as wine and is wine classified as wine. mead is naturally very sweet and super delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why drink mead. I think it's because it tastes amazing it is all the benefits of wine but is a bit sweeter but not artificially fake. One downside is that people will think your hipster especially if you ask for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried Tamarac Jacks Sawyer Mead It's made with added hops which gives an extra beer flavor to the mead which is a crazy combination with that sweet from the mead and the bitter from the hops. It's incredibly delicious and I would recommend trying it. It's a nice entryway from beer to mead.

      <h3>Molson Canadian vs Coors Light</h3>
      <img src="img/Coorslight.jpg" alt="Coorslight" style="width:365px;height:223px;">
      <img src="img/MolsonCanadian.jpg" alt="Molson Canadian" style="width:365px;height:223px;">
      <p>
        The two beers that are entering the arena today are the two staples at Rogers place Molson Canadian and Coors Light. The occasion is being at the game.  The Edmonton Oilers will play their first game on January 13th and because of COVID-19 I cannot go to the rink and test the beers So I'll be doing it at home I bought a king can of each which is 713 milliliters.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the puck drop I cracked open the first brew which was the Coors Light at first I thought the taste was a little tart but then my palate adapted it tasted like the perfect hockey beer I took a sip and close my eyes and listen to the TV and I felt like I was at the game in real life so I have to give it props for that. The beer was extremely drinkable. It was a classic light beer very smooth and super easy to drink. With two or three sips left the Oilers give up a goal against and the occasion of being at the rink was ruined I wanna be winning when I'm at the games and I want my beer to reflect that.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the second period started I open up the Canadian taking the first sip the flavors we're much better I wrote down in my notes under view in the beer that this beer tastes better. One of the downsides with that so I found it was harder to drink it took me a lot longer to finish the Canadian than the Coors I don't know if that's if I enjoy it more or Coors makes a more drinkable beer. I continue to watch the game the Oilers continued to lose and the same is the Coors it doesn't change the Oilers lose and the special occasion of the Oiler's first game is ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canadian win's on taste but Coors wins on drinkability. And now for The X Factor which one is better to drink add an Oilers game they both lose cause the Oilers lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a tie no one won especially the Oilers.
