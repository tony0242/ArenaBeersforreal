      <h2>Troubled Monk</h2>
      <p>
        Troubled Monk makes craft beer, spirits, soda, and canned cocktails in Red Deer, Alberta!
      </p>
      <p>
        A monk sits, furiously scratching away at his parchment.It is near dawn and his candles have burnt down to near nothing. Still, he cannot rest until he’s finished. He won’t rest.Open jars of grains surround him, some spilled next to his parchment.He runs his hands through them before bringing them to his nose.He smiles as he lifts his parchment into the light. After countless experiments, this is it. The perfect recipe. A beer fine enough to share. This Monk isn’t your typical devotee.He has an unmatched passion for his craft and the will to go anywhere to find the right ingredients.And tonight, his devotion to his craft has paid off.
