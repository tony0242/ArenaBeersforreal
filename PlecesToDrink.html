      <h2>Welcome To Arena Beers</h2>
      <p>Welcome to your new home for all information when it comes to brew. Here we'll put beer in an arena In a fight to see which is the best brew in your life. That's not the only thing we do at Arena beers we also go to your favorite arena and taste the best beers.
      </p>
      <p>
          When comparing beer there are three main components taste, drinkability, and occasion. Taste is very important when the beer does not taste good you don't wanna drink it is straightforward. Drinkability is how easy it goes down your gullet. I believe the perfect beer tastes great and is easy to drink you could have some dark beers that taste like chocolate but have a hard time going down because there's so much in the beer. The last factor is drinking for an occasion if you're at a party and you're playing beer pong you're not gonna waste a triple brewed barrel-aged dark stout are you no you're gonna put a pilsner in the Cup and shoot it down so the drink for the occasion is very important.
      </p>
      <h2>Battle Zone</h2>
      <p>The battle zone is where we set up two beers to compete against each other it could be anything from high-class beer to low-class beer. Each time there will be a special factor that could determine which beer is best.</p>
      </p>
      <h2>Brew Rundown</h2>

      <p>
      The brew breakdown isn't really breakdown a special type of beer or something that's less commonly known these tend to be a bit more serious but still just as fun and knowledgeable as the Battlezone.
